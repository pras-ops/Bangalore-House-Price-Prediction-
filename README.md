# Bangalore Housing Price Prediction Project

## Overview

The Bangalore Housing Price Prediction project aims to predict the housing prices in Bangalore for a given locality using machine learning techniques. The project involves data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
The project directory is structured as follows:
$ ./tree-md .

- The `data/` directory contains the raw data and processed data subdirectories, where you can store the respective data files.
- The `notebooks/` directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, feature engineering, and model training.
- The `scripts/` directory can be used to store any additional scripts or code files.
- The `reports/` directory contains the `report.md` file, which provides a detailed report on the project, and the `visualizations/` subdirectory, where you can save any generated visualizations.
- The `README.md` file is the current file you are reading, which provides an overview of the project and its structure.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can find the required libraries in the Jupyter notebooks under the `notebooks/` directory.
2. Place the raw data files in the `data/raw_data/` directory.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the following order:
   - `Data_Analysis.ipynb` for data analysis and exploration.
   - `Feature_Engineering.ipynb` for feature engineering and preprocessing.
   - `model_training.ipynb` for training and evaluating the machine learning models.
4. The generated visualizations will be saved in the `reports/visualizations/` directory.
5. The final project report will be available in the `reports/report.md` file.

Feel free to explore the project files, modify the code, and adapt it to your specific needs.
